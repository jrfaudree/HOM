## Advice on Doing Homework

### Make life easy for the grader
  * Write your name on the top-right of the first page.
  * Write the title "Homework x.y" on the top-left of the first page.
  * Number all problems, and their parts, as they are in the textbook.
  * _Legibly_ write the problems in order, and space things so they are easy to find.
  * Follow directions.  When you are asked for an explanation, make sure to give one!
  * Turn your homework in on time using Gradescope at the [Canvas site](https://canvas.alaska.edu/courses/13188).

### Making Homework effective for you
  * Attempt all problems _before_ looking at the solutions.
  * After working the problems, check your answers and re-attempt any that are incorrect.
  * Attempt all problems at least two days in advance.  This way you can ask questions if you don't understand!
  * Its pathetic to _start_ by copying the solution.

### Ask for help

Ask for help in these places:
  * In lecture.  You will not be the only one with that kind of problem!
  * At the [Math Lab](https://uaf.edu/dms/mathlab/).
  * During Bueler's [Office Hours](http://bueler.github.io/OffHrs.htm).
