\heading{Catalog Course Description} 

Important periods in the history of mathematics, including mathematics of Ancient Babylon, Mesopotamia, Greece, China and India, medieval Europe, the Middle East and the Renaissance; the development of geometry, algebra and calculus. Other areas in the development and philosophy of mathematics will be studied as time permits.\\

\heading{Student Learning Outcomes}

Students completing the course will have a broad sense of the historical development of numerical representation, geometry, algebra and calculus. Some additional and more specific goal are listed below.
\begin{clist}
\item Understand mathematics as a science and an art.
\item Recognize how cultural, social, economic, political, and environmental forces act on the development of mathematics.
\item Be knowledgeable of some of the original problems whose solutions (or attempts at solutions) motivated initial development of the four major topics.
\item Understand the interrelations among the various branches of mathematics and the dynamic nature of mathematics both historically and in the present day.
\item Develop a flexible understanding of common mathematical concepts including notation, solutions to algebraic equations, and common algebraic equations.
\end{clist}

\heading{Class Time}
Class will begin by going over the \href{https://jrfaudree.github.io/HOM2025/tickets.html}{ticket} in the door. Then, we will explore in more detail the mathematical topic of the day typically by doing math.


\heading{Tentative Schedule}
A tentative schedule is below. The course website contains a \href{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRljb1-0lJ9CtIRxdMsZyeBSeQeEZfkl7WBYEpcGmgYnoMynhaaJGCkPKR3t-NxstMAChrq4HY-ms9D/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true}{day-to-day schedule} for the semester anticipating
the topics to be covered each class, the due dates,
midterms, and so forth.

\heading{Office Hours and Communication}
I will schedule formal office hours,
which will be listed linked from the course webpage. Students can also schedule meetings with their instructor outside of regular office hours. 

I will use Canvas to send announcements. If I need to contact you, we will first try to do this in class. My second method will be to send an email to you via Canvas. Thus, you will want to make sure that the email address in Canvas is one that you check regularly. Note that in Canvas it is possible to set up text alerts. However, you must login to Canvas and adjust the setting for your account. Neither email nor text alerts are automatic.

\heading{Evaluation and Grades}
Grades are determined as follows; 
each component of the grade is discussed subsequently in
the syllabus.
 
\begin{multicols}{2}

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
Tickets& 12\%\\
\hline
Homework& 12\% \\

\hline
Project & 16\%\\
\hline
Final Exam& 20\% \\
\hline
total& 100\%\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\vskip 6pt
Letter grades will be assigned according to the following scale.
This scale is a guarantee; the instructors reserve the right to lower the thresholds.

B &  83--86\% & D & 63--66\%&&\cr
B- & 80-82\% & D- & 60--62\%&&\cr
}}\hfil}
\end{multicols}

\heading{Reading \& Tickets in the Door}
At the end of every class, a reading from your textbook will be assigned with corresponding questions whose answers you will submit at the beginning of the next class. The sheet of questions is called your \textbf{ticket in the door} which you will submit at the beginning of the next class. Class will begin by discussing the questions from the daily ticket.  Every student is expected to voluntarily contribute to the discussion. This implies that every student is expected to participate without prompting from the instructor and to make space for others to participate. For each ticket, a student earns a score of 0, 1 or 2 depending on whether the ticket was complete, submitted on time, and participation was voluntary and robust. 

\heading{Homework}
Homework assignments typically consist of a selection of problems at the end of each section of our textbook. Homework is written (on paper or tablet) and turned in on Canvas.  Help with scanning homework can be found under \href{https://jrfaudree.github.io/HOM2025/techHelp.html}{Technology Help} on the course webpage. Complete worked solutions to all problems are provided in advance on Canvas. Consequently, your homework will be graded based on \emph{effort} and \emph{completion}.  All students should earn 100\% of their homework points!

Clearly, it is possible to short-circuit the homework by copying the solutions. It should also be clear that (a) this is a bad idea and (b) your instructor/TA will know you have done this. The goal in providing answers and solutions is to foster the use of homework as a \emph{learning experience}. 

\heading{Midterms}
There will be two midterm exams this semester, to be held on Friday 21 February and Friday 11 April. Make-up midterms will be given only for documented excused absences. Always contact your instructor if you miss a midterm.

\heading{Project}
The project will be broken into pieces. It is an opportunity for you to learn about a topic that interests you. There are two main components of the project: (1) a paper (which does not need to be long) and (2) a presentation to the class. The topic must be approved in advance and must be a \textbf{mathematical} idea/concept/theorem commonly taught in a junior-level undergraduate mathematics curriculum or below, the simpler the better.  

\heading{Final Exam} 
The cumulative final exam will be held Friday May 2, 10:15am-12:15pm. A make-up final exam will be given only in extenuating circumstances, for documented and excused reasons at the discretion of the instructors.

\heading{Tutoring and Resources}
\vskip -30pt\strut
\begin{clist}
	\item The Math and Stat Lab, Chapman Building Room 305, offers tutors. 
	See 

	\url{https://www.uaf.edu/dms/mathlab/} for schedules and availability.
	\item One-on-one (or small group) tutoring is available in 
Chapman Building Room 201. You must schedule an
appointment; see \url{https://www.uaf.edu/dms/mathlab/}.
	\item Student Support Services offers free tutoring in many subjects to students who qualify for their program.
	\item ASUAF offers private tutoring for a small fee (based on student income).
\end{clist}

\heading{Rules and Policies}
\vskip -20pt

\subheading{Incomplete Grade} 
Incomplete (I) will only be given in
  DMS courses in cases where
  the student has completed the majority (normally all but the last
  three weeks) of a course with a grade of C or better, but for
  personal reasons beyond his/her control has been unable to complete
  the course during the regular term. Negligence or indifference are
  not acceptable reasons for the granting of an incomplete
  grade. 

\subheading{Late Withdrawals} 
A withdrawal after the deadline
  (currently 9 weeks into the semester) from a DMS course will
  normally be granted only in cases where the student is performing
  satisfactorily (i.e., C or better) in a course, but has exceptional
  reasons, beyond his/her control, for being unable to complete the
  course. These exceptional reasons should be detailed in writing to
  the instructor, department head and dean.

\subheading{No Early Final Examinations}
 Normally, a student will not be
  allowed to take a final exam early. Exceptions can be made by
  individual instructors, but should only be allowed in exceptional
  circumstances and in a manner which doesn't endanger the security of
  the exam.

\subheading{Academic Dishonesty}
Academic dishonesty, including cheating and plagiarism, will not
be tolerated.  It is a violation of the Student Code of Conduct
and will be punished according to UAF procedures.
