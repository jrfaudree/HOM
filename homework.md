## Homework Guidelines

  * The problems in the list below come from our textbook.
  * Homework is due by 11:59PM on the due date on the [Schedule](assets/general/schedule.pdf).  
  * Turn in your homework via Gradescope, which is accessed via [Canvas](https://canvas.alaska.edu).
  * Complete solutions are posted _in advance_ at the [Canvas](https://canvas.alaska.edu). 
  * Homework will be graded on completion and effort.  You should get 100% on your homework!

* **HW 5**

Section 4.2 Problems 2,3,6,8 

Note that for the 4.2 problems, you can use the hints in the book. You can also go to the online copy of Euclid's elements and translate his argument into your own words. (link [here](http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/elements/elements.html).)

Problem A: Read [Prop 7](http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/elements/bookII/propII7.html) of Book II of Euclid's Elements. If AB=x,AC=c, and CB=b in the diagram, write the algebraic equality described in Proposition 7. Then show algebraically that this proposition is true. Note the hardest part of this problem is understanding what Proposition 7 is saying.

Problem B: Repeat the directions for Problem A but for [Prop 9](http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/elements/bookII/propII9.html). Assume AC=c, AD=a, DB=b, and CD=d.

Section 4.3

Problem C: Read Euclid's proof of the infinitude of primes ([here](http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/elements/bookIX/propIX20.html) and describe the ways in which his proof is different from a modern proof.

Problem D: Find two open problems in mathematics concerning prime numbers. 

Problem E: Use the Euclidean Algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of 12012 and 1430.

* **HW 6**

Section 4.4 Problem 4

Ptolemy’s Theorem is stated precisely (with picture) in Problem 1 from this section.

Problem A: Show that Ptolemy’s Theorem applies to every rectangle of sides a and b and then
confirm that the conclusion of Ptolemy’s Theorem is correct for every rectangle.

Problem B: Let the points A, B, C, and D, have the coordinates below:

A=( - sqrt{2} , - sqrt{2} ), B = ( - 1 , sqrt{3} ), C = ( sqrt{3} , 1 ), D = ( 2, 0 )

1. Show that the points ABCD lie on a circle.

2. Explain how you know that if point D was changed to the coordinates (2,-½), the points
ABCD would not lie on a circle.

3. Confirm that the conclusion Ptolemy’s Theorem applies to the quadrilateral with corners
ABCD (the original D!).


Section 4.5 Problems 2,4,5,11

Problem C: Use modern calculus to find the area of the parabolic segment bounded by y=x^2
and y=x+2
