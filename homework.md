Section 4.2 Problems 2,3,6,8,12,Problem A (below)

**Problem A** Show that the figure on page 160 does construct the solution to ax=bc.

Note that for problems 2,3,6,and 8, you can use the hints in the book. You can also go to the online copy of Euclid's elements and translate his argument into your own words. (link [here](http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/elements/elements.html).)

Section 4.3 Problems B-F below.

**Problem B** Read [Prop 7](http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/elements/bookII/propII7.html) of Book II of Euclid's Elements. If AB=x,AC=c, and CB=b in the diagram, write the algebraic equality described in Proposition 7. Then show algebraically that this proposition is true. Note the hardest part of this problem is understanding what Proposition 7 is saying.

**Problem C** Repeat the directions for Problem B but for [Prop 9](http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/elements/bookII/propII9.html). Assume AC=c, AD=a, DB=b, and CD=d.

**Problem D** Read Euclid's proof of the infinitude of primes ([here](http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/elements/bookIX/propIX20.html) and describe how his proof is different from a modern proof.)

**Problem E** Find two open problems in mathematics concerning prime numbers. 

**Problem F** Use the Euclidean Algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of 12012 and 1430.

* <span style="color:blue">**HW 5**</span>

Section 4.4 Problem 4, Problem A below.

**Problem A** Suppose you wake up on a new planet with a different sun but the same planet-sun orientation as on earth. Suppose two people place a 1-meter-long stick and measure its shadow on the same day. At location X, the stick has no shadow but at location Y the stick has a shadow of length 0.1 m. If Y is 500 km north of X, find the radius of this new planet using Eratosthenes' method.

Section 5.3 Problems 13, 16, 17, Problems A-C below

**Problem A** Return to Diophantus' Problem 8 of Book II (discussed on page 220 of our text).
 - (i) What solution will you get if instead of setting 16-x^2=(2x-4)^2, you set 16-x^2=(mx-4)^2.
 - (ii) Find a rational solution to the equation x^2+y^2=16 that Diophantus' strategy will never construct.

**Problem B** Go to the translation of Diophantus' *Arithmetica* [here](https://ia801603.us.archive.org/18/items/diophantusofalex00heatiala/diophantusofalex00heatiala.pdf) and read Proposition 27 from Book I.
- (i) Rewrite the problem in modern notation.
- (ii) Write out Diophantus' solution in modern notation.

**Problem C** Go to the translation of Diophantus' *Arithmetica* [here](https://ia801603.us.archive.org/18/items/diophantusofalex00heatiala/diophantusofalex00heatiala.pdf) and read Proposition 14 from Book III.
- (i) Rewrite the problem in modern notation.
- (ii) Write out Diophantus' solution in modern notation.

 - **Section 8.1** Problems 3,6,7a,12a,13

> Comments:
 * (#3) Why is Recorde's *The Whetstone of Witte* in this section? What would Recorde have intended to illustrate with this problem?
 * (#6) Look on page 352.
 * (#7a) The definition of Nap.log is at the bottom of page 353.
 * (#12a) In what context and by whom have you seen this strategy before?
 * (#13) This problem is mostly for fun but it illustrates the durability of *constructing* solutions to problems we perceive as strictly *numerical*.
